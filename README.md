# Strobe Torch
## Purpose
Little flashlight (or torch in UK) to calibrate the speed of a turntable with the help of a strobe disc or the strobe rings along the platter.

To use such strobe discs one needs a light source with a 50, 60 or 300 Hz strobe light. In the older days a simple light bulb with filament was enough to did the job. In the time of LEDs and compact fluorescent light sources one needs an additional helper like this to work with a strobe disc.

The needed frequency depends on your strobe disc. Most of them have at least 50 and 60 Hz in parallel (or two sides). There are "high-resolution" strobe discs that need a 300 Hz light source for calibration.

Also because this strobe torch uses a crystal oscillator it is more precise than a light bulb.

## Usage
The device is designed to be very simple to use.

There are three momentary buttons on the front. Each button represents one frequency. So simply press the 50 Hz button and you get a white light beam that flickers with 50 Hz.

When you release the button, the light goes off and the device consumes no energy.
